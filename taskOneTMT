# Test Management Tool Project

## Overview
The Test Management Tool is a project created by the Endava team for creating and managing test cases. In our initial task, the objective was to thoroughly test the application, identifying visual and backend defects, and subsequently documenting our findings. 

## Task Highlights
In collaboration with my teammate Victor, we successfully identified and documented various errors during the testing phase. Our focus encompassed both visual discrepancies and backend issues. This process not only contributed to improving the overall quality of the application but also laid the foundation for comprehensive documentation.

## Key Contributions
- **Visual Defects**: Through meticulous testing, we pinpointed and documented visual issues within the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Backend Errors**: Our testing efforts extended to the backend, where we identified and documented issues affecting the application's functionality.

## Documentation
The documentation generated from our testing efforts is available in the respective folders of this repository. Feel free to explore and provide feedback.

## Collaboration
Collaboration is key to the success of this project. If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or wish to contribute, please don't hesitate to create issues or pull requests.
