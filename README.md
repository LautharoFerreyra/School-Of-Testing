# School of Testing - Automation Project

Welcome to the repository of the School of Testing automation project, an exciting opportunity provided by Endava to learn Automation Testing!

## Main Tools
In this project, we will delve into the fascinating world of automation using the following key tools:
- **Postman**: For efficient creation and execution of API requests.
- **DevTools**: Integrated development tools for inspecting and debugging web applications.
- **Cypress**: A powerful end-to-end testing framework for modern web applications.

## Programming Languages
We will explore and apply various programming languages in our automation journey, including:
- **JavaScript**: For scripting and testing within the browser environment.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript to enhance code robustness.
- **Java**: We will also explore the possibility of using Java for specific tests.

## Repository Structure
- **/postman**: Contains Postman collections for API testing.
- **/cypress**: Here you will find test scripts written with Cypress.
- **/devtools**: Files related to the use of DevTools.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and send pull requests. Together, we will build a robust set of test automation.

Thank you for joining this exciting learning adventure at the School of Testing!
