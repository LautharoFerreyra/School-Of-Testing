# API Testing with Chai and Mocha in TypeScript

This project is aimed at practicing and improving API testing skills using Chai and Mocha, along with TypeScript for both coding and testing. The target application for testing is "Endava Test Management Tool (TMT)."

## Objective

The main goal of this repository is to conduct API testing on a specific application using the mentioned tools. Specifically, we will be testing the "Endava Test Management Tool (TMT)".

## Technologies Used

- **Chai**: Assertion library for making assertions more readable and expressive in tests.
- **Mocha**: Test execution framework for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **Endava Test Management Tool (TMT)**: The specific application that will be tested.
